# Version Control Log

- **11/12/2022; v0.0.6**: Modified *phonological_rules*, *phonemes*, *utils*.
  - Added X (== [*]) value as single character wildcard for a phonetic rule.
  - Added more possible combinations of multiple targets, replacements and environments.
  - Fixed small bugs with transliteration functions. 
  - Added a function to find an IPA char by providing a descriptor list *find_ipachar_by_descriptors* in *utils* (will be used in the future).
  - Added the option to initialize a *PhonemeCatalog* with *Phonemes* with multiple allophones without directly defining a *Phoneme* (via a dictionary).
- **10/12/2022; v0.0.5**: Replaced *CustomTrasliterator* with *Trasliterator*. Modified *PhonologicalRule*.
  - Inspired by the "transliterate" package the previous version used, I wrote a simpler *Transliterator*. 
  - Modified *PhonologicalRule* to reflect the *Transliterator* name-change.
- **03/04/2022; v0.0.4**: Added *CustomTrasliterator*, *PhonologicalRule*. Modified *Phone*, *Phoneme* and *PhonemeCatalog*.
  - Added *check_descriptors* in utils to match descriptor lists and *sort_by_element_attribute* to sort an object by a specific attribute.
  - Added *has_descriptors* in *Phone* class based on the *check_descriptors* of the utils.
  - Modified *Phoneme* to be initialized by a single phone transcription.
  - Modified *Phoneme* and *PhonemeCatalog* to utilize the *check_descriptors*.
  - Added *CustomTrasliterator* to go back and forth between two lists of strings.
  - Added *PhonologicalRule* that holds information about a specific sound change.
  - Added a *tests* folder. 
- **29/03/2022; v0.0.3**: Added *Phone* class. Modified *Phoneme(Catalog)* to use allophones (tuple of *Phones*).
  - Defined *Phone* as a class to hold information about a specific phone (previously done (wrongly) by *Phoneme*).
  - Modified *Phoneme* to use a tuple of *Phones* as different allophones. Used sets for common and all descriptors.
  - Modified *PhonemeCatalog* to comply with the changes in *Phonemes*.
  - Added sort_by_element_attribute utility function to easily sort list of X-type objects by X.attr attributes.
- **27/03/2022; v0.0.2**: Added Phoneme list class.
  - Defined *PhonemeCatalog* as a class to hold a list of *Phonemes*.
  - Defined *UniquePhonemeCatalog* as a class to hold a list of unique *Phonemes*.
  - *ImmutableProperty* will now raise an AttributeError if an attempt to change its value is made.
- **26/03/2022; v0.0.1**: Initial commit.
  - Defined *LinguisticObject* as a base object for later operations, such as object comparisons and tracking the object progression over different language evolution stages.
  - Defined *TrackingID* to track changes of *LinguisticObjects* over different language evolution stages.
  - Defined *ImmutableProperty* as the main properties of *LinguisticObjects* and *TrackingID*.
  - Defined *Phoneme* as a *LinguisticObject* with *ImmutableProperties*: *unicode_string*, *romanization*, *ipa_chars*, and *descriptors*.
